# FIRMEST Workshop py-fatigue

This repository contains a **Python notebook and supporting scripts** developed for the **FIRMEST Workshop** on fatigue analysis. It is designed to familiarize users with:  

- **Strain data preprocessing**: Cleaning, filtering, and structuring raw strain measurements from sensors.  
- **Material definitions**: Assigning material properties relevant for fatigue calculations.  
- **Fatigue analysis workflows**: Computing cumulative fatigue damage, generating time series, and visualizing results.  
- **Integration with the OWI metadatabase**: Accessing geometric and fatigue-related information through a Python API.  

The notebook provides hands-on examples to help participants:  

- Load and preprocess structural strain datasets.  
- Define and apply material properties for fatigue calculations.  
- Fetch geometry and fatigue metadata directly from the OWI metadatabase.  
- Visualize cumulative fatigue damage with respect to time and operational conditions.  

This repository is intended for users interested in **offshore wind turbine structural health monitoring and fatigue analysis**, offering a practical introduction to combining experimental data with database-driven structural insights.
